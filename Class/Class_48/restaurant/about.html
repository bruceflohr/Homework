  The original Blue Hill restaurant, opened in 2000, is located in Greenwich Village, 
New York City. Hidden three steps below street level, the restaurant occupies a 
landmark "speakeasy" just off of Washington Square Park.
Blue Hill's menu showcases local food and a wine list with producers who respect 
artisanal techniques. Ingredients come from nearby farms, including Blue Hill Farm 
in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, 
a forty-five minute drive from New York City. Guests can choose from the four-course 
"Tasting Menu" or opt for the "Farmer's Feast," a six-course tasting inspired by the 
week's harvest.
