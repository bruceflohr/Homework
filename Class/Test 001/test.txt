Try to make it look as close to my example as possible. Colors, spacing, etc.
Use HTML 5 semantic containers whenever possible: header, footer, nav, section, etc...

General
Font used on page is helvetica (mac), arial (windows), sans-serif (backup)

Nav and Footer
Nav and footer stay in place at top and bottom.
- These are black with white text and take up full screen width.
- Content in them does not begin all the way on left of screen. Content is centered vertically exactly same as main content.
- The links in the nav must be in a UL.
- The links in the nav are not underlined - except when user puts mouse over link. Then they change to red and get underlined
- Links in header nav bring you to that section of page

Page title
- Colored background, content centered.
- Some space above and below content.
- Contains Title and subtitle.
- Title is UPPERCASE regardless of actual text included in HTML.
- Subtitle has some text in italics

Main Content
- Content not full screen - nicely centered (can be fluid, or fixed width (pixels or percentage)). 
- Content not covered by navbar or footer.

Products
Products are layed out evenly dividing the available space for the 3 products on screens 1000px or larger.
- There are horizontal lines BETWEEN the products
- On smaller screens (< 1000px) they each take up full width like other content. Horizontal lines go away.
- Each product name is centered.
- Each product has an image or video in it - at least one should be video. Choose the image to be shown for the video before its played.
- Make sure images / video behave (fill up available width but dont overlap one another) even as screensize changes.
- Text below products is justified. (use text-align justify - we may not have mentioned that one in class)

- Form is posted (to non existent page) when submitted.
- Both fields are required . Email should be validated. - (On browsers that support new HTML input types)
- Form content is centered.
- Form has colored background with rounded corners on form and on inputs. Inputs have shadows.
- The form is displayed centered inside a colored area with rounded corners.
- On smaller screens (< 1000px) each form part (label + input or button) is on its own line

- Text is centered. numbers are right justified. Years are bold (like headers...). Totals are red.
